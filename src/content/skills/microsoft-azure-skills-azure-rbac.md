Use the 'azure__documentation' tool to find the minimal role definition that matches the desired permissions the user wants to assign to an identity. If no built-in role matches the desired permissions, use the 'azure__extension_cli_generate' tool to create a custom role definition with the desired permissions. Then use the 'azure__extension_cli_generate' tool to generate the CLI commands needed to assign that role to the identity. Finally, use the 'azure__bicepschema' and 'azure__get_azure_bestpractices' tools to provide a Bicep code snippet for adding the role assignment. If user is asking about role necessary to set access, refer to Prerequisites for Granting Roles down below:

## Prerequisites for Granting Roles

To assign RBAC roles to identities, you need a role that includes the `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permission. The most common roles with this permission are:

- **User Access Administrator** (least privilege - recommended for role assignment only)
- **Owner** (full access including role assignment)
- **Custom Role** with `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`

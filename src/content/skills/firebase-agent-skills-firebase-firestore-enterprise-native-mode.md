  Firebase Agent Skills
</h1>


A collection of skills for AI coding agents, to help them understand and work with Firebase more effectively. 

Skills are packaged instructions and scripts that extend agent capabilities, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) format.

## Installation

### Option 1: Agent Skills CLI 

For most popular AI-assistive tools, you can use the `skills` CLI to install Firebase agent skills:

```bash
npx skills add firebase/skills
```

### Option 2: Gemini CLI Extension

This repository is configured as a Gemini CLI extension. You can add it using the Gemini CLI:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/firebase/skills
```

### Option 3: Claude Plugin

1. Add the Firebase marketplace for Claude plugins:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add firebase/skills
```

Install the Claude plugin for Firebase:

```bash
claude plugin install firebase@firebase
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace list
```

### Option 4: Manual Set Up

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firebase/skills.git
```

2. Copy the contents of the `skills` directory to the appropriate location for your AI tool. Common locations include:
   - **Cursor**: `.cursor/rules/`
   - **Windsurf**: `.windsurfrules/`
   - **GitHub Copilot**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (or project-specific instruction files)

### Option 5: Local Path via Agent Skills CLI

The `skills` CLI also supports installing skills from a local directory. If you have cloned this repository, you can add skills by pointing the CLI to your local folder:

```bash
npx skills add /path/to/your/local/firebase-skills/skills
```

If you make changes to the local skills repository and want to update your project with the new changes, you can update them by running:

```bash
npx skills experimental_install
```

### Option 6: Local Development (Live Symlinking)

If you are actively contributing to or developing these skills, using `npx skills add` or copying files means you have to manually update them every time you make a change. Instead, use a symlink so that changes in your local clone are immediately reflected in your test project.

For example, to test with Cursor:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/firebase-skills/skills /path/to/your/test-project/.cursor/rules
```

3. Commit changes: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`

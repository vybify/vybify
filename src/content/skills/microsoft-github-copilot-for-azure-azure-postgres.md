## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before installing the plugin, ensure the following tools are installed:

#### Git

Git is required to add the marketplace plugin. If it is not installed, you will see an error like:
`Failed to add marketplace: Failed to fetch GitHub marketplace microsoft/azure-skills: Error: spawn git ENOENT`

**Windows (winget):**
```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install git
```

#### Node.js

Node.js is required for the Azure MCP server. If it is not installed, you may see errors such as:
- Windows: `'npx' is not recognized as an internal or external command`
- macOS/Linux: `npx: command not found`
- Or the MCP server may fail silently with `npx failed to connect to azure`

**Windows (winget):**
```powershell
winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS -e --source winget
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install node
```

### Installation

#### VS Code

The GitHub Copilot for Azure extension installs skills when the extension activates. At that point, you may see a toast notification like the following (if you don't see it, you can use the manual commands below):

![Toast notification asking "GitHub Copilot for Azure can install skills to enhance your experience. Would you like to install Azure skills?" with Install, Not Now, and Don't Ask Again buttons](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2ac7a0d-1f72-4af5-8cb5-a38f344a9244)

To manually install skills from the Command Palette, the following commands are available:

- `@azure: Install Azure Skills Globally` — installs to your home directory (for example `~` on macOS/Linux or `%UserProfile%` on Windows), available in all workspaces
- `@azure: Install Azure Skills Locally` — installs to the current workspace folder, workspace-scoped
- `@azure: Uninstall Azure Skills Globally` — removes globally installed skills

#### Copilot CLI

To install the Azure plugin into Copilot CLI:

1. Add the marketplace with `/plugin marketplace add microsoft/azure-skills`
2. Install the plugin with `/plugin install azure@azure-skills`
3. Update the plugin with `/plugin update azure@azure-skills`

#### Claude Code

To install the Azure plugin into Claude Code, either:

- Run `/plugin install azure@claude-plugins-official`, or
- Run `/plugin` and search for "azure" in the marketplace

To update the plugin:

```
/plugin update azure@claude-plugins-official
```

## Sovereign Cloud Configuration

By default, the Azure MCP server connects to the Azure Public Cloud. If you use a sovereign cloud (Azure China Cloud or Azure US Government), you need to configure the MCP server to use the appropriate cloud environment.

### Copilot CLI

After installing the plugin from the marketplace, the skills are installed in `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/` on macOS/Linux (or `%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\installed-plugins\` on Windows). Edit the `&lt;skill_installation_dir&gt;/azure-skills/azure/.mcp.json` file in the installed plugin directory to add the `--cloud` argument:

> **Note:** If you are developing locally using `copilot --plugin-dir ./output`, edit `output/.mcp.json` in your local build output instead.

**Azure China Cloud:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "azure": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@azure/mcp@latest", "server", "start", "--cloud", "AzureChinaCloud"]
    }
    // Keep the other MCP server configurations in this file as they are.
  }
}
```
